## Sources - Apna College Java Placement Course

Hello, 

Recently, I started revising my Java concepts along with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from a free course called "Java Placement Course," organized by ApnaCollege. This course is available for free on ApnaCollege's YouTube channel. In this repository, I am saving my Java notes, practice programs, problems, and solutions for future reference and assistance.
